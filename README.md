# Password-Generator
This simple application generates a password based on user-defined criteria when a button is clicked. It prompts the user for various password criteria, ensuring the password meets specified length and character type requirements.

## Note
    The index file and the style.css file were provided by the Teaching staff. I have further completed the project implementing the script.js file for the working functionality of the password generation.

## Features

### Password Length:
    --> Users can choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters.
### Character Types:
    --> Users must select at least one character type from the following options:
            1. Lowercase letters (a-z)
            2. Uppercase letters (A-Z)
            3. Numeric characters (0-9)
            4. Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
### Validation:
    --> The code validates each user input to ensure it meets the specified criteria.
### Password Generation:
    --> Once the user answers the prompts, the application generates a password based on the provided criteria.
### Display:
    --> The generated password is displayed either in an alert or written to the page.
